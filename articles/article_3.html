    <h1>3. A case of Identity</h1>

    <div class="first-letter-do">
      <p>“My dear fellow,” said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire
        in his lodgings at Baker Street, “life is infinitely stranger than anything which
        the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which
        are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window
        hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at
        the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the
        cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations,
        and leading to the most outré results, it would make all fiction with its
        conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.” </p>

      <p>“And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered. “The cases which come to
        light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our
        police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must
        be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.”</p>

      <p>“A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic
        effect,” remarked Holmes. “This is wanting in the police report, where more
        stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details,
        which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon
        it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.”</p>

      <p>I smiled and shook my head. “I can quite understand your thinking so,” I said.
        “Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is
        absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with
        all that is strange and bizarre. But here”—I picked up the morning paper from
        the ground—“let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which
        I come. ‘A husband’s cruelty to his wife.’ There is half a column of print, but I
        know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course,
        the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister
        or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.”</p>

      <p>“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,” said Holmes,
        taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “This is the Dundas separation
        case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in
        connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and
        the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up
        every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you
        will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average
        story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored
        over you in your example.”</p>

      <p>He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the
        lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I
        could not help commenting upon it.</p>

      <p>“Ah,” said he, “I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little
        souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the
        Irene Adler papers.”</p>

      <p>“And the ring?” I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled
        upon his finger.</p>

      <p>“It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I
        served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have
        been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.”</p>

      <p>“And have you any on hand just now?” I asked with interest.</p>

      <p>“Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They are
        important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it
        is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for
        the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation.
        The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more
        obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate
        matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which
        presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have
        something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my
        clients, or I am much mistaken.”</p>

      <p>He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing
        down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw
        that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa
        round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which
        was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From
        under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our
        windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers
        fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who
        leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the
        bell.</p>

      <p> “I have seen those symptoms before,” said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. “Oscillation upon the
        pavement always means an affaire de cœur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too
        delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a
        man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a
        love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to
        resolve our doubts.”</p>

      <p>As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to
        announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small
        black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock
        Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and,
        having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the
        minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.</p>

      <p>“Do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it is a little trying to do
        so much typewriting?”</p>

      <p>“I did at first,” she answered, “but now I know where the letters are without
        looking.” Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a
        violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, goodhumoured face. </p>

      <p>“You’ve heard about me, Mr. Holmes,” she cried, “else how
        could you know all that?”</p>

      <p>“Never mind,” said Holmes, laughing; “it is my business to know things.
        Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should
        you come to consult me?”</p>

      <p>“I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose
        husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for
        dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I’m not rich, but
        still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the
        machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer
        Angel.” </p>

      <p>“Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?” asked Sherlock
        Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.
        Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary
        Sutherland. “Yes, I did bang out of the house,” she said, “for it made me angry to
        see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank—that is, my father—took it all. He
        would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he
        would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me
        mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you.”</p>

      <p>“Your father,” said Holmes, “your stepfather, surely, since the name is
        different.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is
        only five years and two months older than myself.”</p>

      <p>“And your mother is alive?”</p>

      <p>“Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn’t best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when
        she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was nearly fifteen
        years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road,
        and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy,
        the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he
        was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got £ 4700 for the goodwill
        and interest, which wasn’t near as much as father could have got if he had been
        alive.”</p>

      <p>I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and
        inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest
        concentration of attention.</p>
